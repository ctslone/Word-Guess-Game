* Guess any letter to begin the game.
* You cannot guess anything other than a letter.
* You cannot guess the same letter twice.

## Mobile Friendly

One goal while creating this app (and for all of my apps) is to have it be mobile-friendly, meaning it works on your phone or tablet just as it would on your desktop or laptop.

Feel free to open the app on your favorite mobile device or use the developer tools in your favorite browser to view the mobile layout!

## Challenges

A few challenges that I faced when creating this game were:
* Looping through the randomly selected word and getting the letters to be displayed as underscores 
* Displaying a correct letter guess in the appropriate underscore in the winning word.
* Making the app mobile responisve.
